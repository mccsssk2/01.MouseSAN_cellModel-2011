Data for the sensitivity analysis was generated using
this code. The simulations were performed on UoM
Bull Itanium system around 2008-2010.
The outputs were analysed using Manchester Inst.
of Biosciences' MI codes that were proprietary at 
the time.
The MI codes handled continuous variables, as 
opposed to the discrete variable codes that is now
distributed.
